# Recursive-RDM
Code for senior thesis

## TODO:
* implement timing tests to find bottleneck in code
* ~~check if one graph is a permutation of another~~
* check what is taking up the most memory/how to reduce that
* timing tests to compare not checking permutation + checking permutation + generating graphs

## Notes:
* takes ~ 2.5 hrs to calculate all probabilities on n=7
* 23767 s --> 6.6 hrs generate all unique graphs on n=7
* * now 234 s with further optimization
